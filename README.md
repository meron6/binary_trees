# Binary Tree Project

## Overview
This project involves implementing various functions related to binary trees in C. The tasks include creating nodes, inserting nodes, traversing the tree, calculating properties like height and size, and performing rotations and checks for tree properties.

## Requirements
- The project should be developed and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
- Only allowed editors such as vi, vim, or emacs should be used.
- Code must adhere to the Betty style guide.
- Each file should have no more than 5 functions.
- Global variables are not allowed.
- All functions should be prototyped in `binary_trees.h`.
- Use `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89` options with gcc for compilation.
- Include a `README.md` file explaining the project, its requirements, and how to use it.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:
- `binary_trees.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and necessary struct definitions.
- `0-some_function.c`, `1-another_function.c`, ...: Source files containing function implementations for each task.
- `main.c`: Example main file for testing purposes. (Note: Provided for testing, not to be pushed to the repo)
- `print_tree.c`: Provided function for tree visualization.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## How to Use
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Implement the required functions in separate `.c` files.
4. Prototype the functions in `binary_trees.h`.
5. Compile the project using `gcc` with the provided options.
6. Test your functions using your own test cases or the provided `main.c`.
7. Make sure your code passes the provided checker script and auto-review.
8. Once everything is implemented and tested, push your changes to the repository.

## Testing
You can test your functions using the provided `main.c` file or by writing your own test cases. Compile the test file along with your source files and run the executable to verify the correctness of your implementations.
